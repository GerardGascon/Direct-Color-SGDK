# Direct Color using SGDK

This demo is just a proof-of-concept using SGDK.

Made this using the project made by Chilly Willy ([Direct Color Demo using DMA](https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1203)) as a base. Ported the base project to SGDK and the color converter to C# because of the crashes that I had using C.

For the image converter you just have to drag and drop a 198x224px (the visible area will be a bit smaller) PNG image onto the .exe file that is created when compiling the app. Then it will automatically generate the output binary compatible with the Direct Color DMA method.
